# Mini-Stack/Mini-Queue Data Structures Project

Simplified instances of a standard stack and queue. Both the stack and queue are implemented three ways, using: a vector, a list, and a dynamiac array. As noted in the d_except.h source file, the d_except.h file was provided to me by the Salisbury University Computer Science department for the purpose of completing this project.
